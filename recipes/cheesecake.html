        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
        <p>Cheesecake has long been one of my favourite desserts so I knew that it needed to be added to this collection.
            It's rich and creamy and oh so delicious. I will admit, it is a bit time consuming, but trust me <mark>it is worth the effort.</mark></p>
        
        

        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Graham Cracker Crust</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
                    <li>2 tbs sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tbs brown sugar</li>
                    <li>7 tbs melted butter</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Cheesecake Filling</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>32 oz softened cream cheese</li>
                    <li>1 cup sugar</li>
                    <li>2/3 cups sour cream</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
                    <li>4 eggs at room temperature, lightly beaten</li>
                </ul>

        </ul>

        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325F</li>
            <li>Prepare Graham Cracker crust first by combining graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and brown sugar, and stirring well. Add melted butter and use a fork to combine ingredients well.</li>
            <li>Pour crumbs into a 9” Springform pan and press firmly into the bottom and up the sides of your pan. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl (using a hand mixer) add cream cheese and stir until smooth and creamy (don’t over-beat or you’ll incorporate too much air).</li>
            <li>Add sugar and stir again until creamy.</li>
            <li>Add sour cream, vanilla extract, and salt, and stir until well-combined. If using a stand mixer, make sure you pause periodically to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a spatula so that all ingredients are evenly incorporated.</li>
            <li>With mixer on low speed, gradually add lightly beaten eggs, one at a time, stirring just until each egg is just incorporated. Once all eggs have been added, use a spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl again and make sure all ingredients are well combined.</li>
            <li>Pour cheesecake batter into prepared springform pan. To insure against leaks, place pan on a cookie sheet that’s been lined with foil.</li>
            <li>Transfer to the center rack of your oven and bake on 325F (160C) for about 75 minutes. Edges will likely have slightly puffed and may have just begun to turn a light golden brown and the center should spring back to the touch but will still be Jello-jiggly. Don't over-bake or the texture will suffer, which means we all suffer.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool on top of the oven³ for 10 minutes. Once 10 minutes has passed, use a knife to gently loosen the crust from the inside of the springform pan (this will help prevent cracks as your cheesecake cools and shrinks).</li>
            <li>Allow cheesecake to cool another 1-2 hours or until near room temperature before transferring to refrigerator and allowing to cool overnight or at least 6 hours. <em>Enjoy!</em> </li>
        </ol>
