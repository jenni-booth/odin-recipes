        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
        <p>Layered flavours of coffee, cream, and cake; what more could you ask for? Tiramisu's name originates from the Italian phrase 
            <em>tirami su</em>, which means &ldquo;pick me up&rdquo;. Trust me when I say that after you give it a taste, 
            you'll also agree that the title is fitting.</p>

        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>8 ounces mascarpone cheese, room temperature</li>
            <li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups cold espresso</li>
            <li>3 tbs coffee liqueur (eg. Khalua)</li>
            <li>1 Package Lady Fingers</li>
            <li>Cocoa powder for dusting on top</li>
        </ul>

        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add whipping cream to a mixing bowl and beat on medium speed with electric mixers (or use a stand mixer). Slowly add sugar and vanilla and continue to beat until stiff peaks. Add mascarpone cheese and mix just until combined. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Add coffee and liqueur to a shallow bowl. Dip the lady fingers in the coffee (Don't soak them--just quickly dip them on both sides to get them wet) and lay them in a single layer on the bottom of an 8x8" or similar size pan. </li>
            <li>Smooth half of the mascarpone mixture over the top. Add another layer of dipped lady fingers. Smooth remaining mascarpone cream over the top.</li>
            <li>Dust cocoa powder generously over the top (I use a fine mesh strainer to do this). Refrigerate for at least three to four hours or up to overnight before serving.</li>

        </ol>
